# ProjectManagementApp-React

A project management app built as a practice project using React

This project was part of the React course on Udemy.
Project built on my own, independent of the course videos
Used a mixture of Tailwind CSS and Styled components to gain experience with both
Did not use ContextAPI or redux as not yet covered in course - Prop drilling a problem as on 16-Nov-23, to be fixed after covering relevant course sections
